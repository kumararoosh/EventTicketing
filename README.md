# Open-Source Ticketing
This application will allow users to manage the distribution and management of digital tickets through email and text. The basic functionality of this app would be:

1. Allow administrative users to enter in information about a new customer.
2. Send a customer a ticket through email and/or text in the form of a QR code.
3. Allow administrative users to "check-in" customers at an event.
4. Give administrative users enough information to verify that the identity of a customer attempting to "check-in", preventing the potential of duplicate use of tickets.
